## Question 1
>I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:
>Records
>Indexing
>I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."
>
>Cheers, George

Hi George,

I would be happy to help. A record is the basic building block of a search engine. Think of it as a snapshot of key information. For example, a product record may contain things like a url, product_name, price, popularity, keywords, short description and image link.

Indexing is a way of storing and optimizing this structured data for very fast searches. Much like a table of contents in a book can be used to quickly find chapters, a search index can be used to quickly locate matching records. Unlike a book, search indices can have records added and removed. 

Once the records are found another key attribute of search is returning the most relevant results. This is where custom ranking comes into play. Custom ranking allows the results to improved based on other attributes - for example, by ranking the most popular products more highly in the results. Here is additional information on custom ranking that may be helpful: [custom ranking](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/must-do/custom-ranking/).

Please let me know if I can provide any assistance. 

Best regards,

-Jason


## Question 2
> Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Hi Matt,

Thank you very much for the feedback. I am sorry to hear that the new dashboard design is more difficult to use, and I will pass this feedback on to the appropriate team. In the meantime, another option to quickly clear and delete indexes is via the API. Here are links to the relevant pages: [delete index](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/delete-index/) & [clear objects](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/clear-objects/).

Please let me know if I can provide any additional information. 

Best regards,

-Jason
